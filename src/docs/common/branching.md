# Branching strategy:
The following branches should be maintained: <br>
 - master : a branch with the last high quality code to be delivered to test
 - develop: this branch serves as an integration branch for features. 
 - features branches: for new functionalities
 - bugfix branches for bug fixes 
 - hotfix branches for bugs detected in production, this branches should be pulled from the release tag
 - enhancement: for modification related to code quality

The naming to be used is:
```
feature/feature-name 
bugfix/fix_discription
hotfix/fix_description
enhancement/enhancement_description
```
